# CSS 
## Images

+ You can control the size of an 
image using the width and 
height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box

+ two common ways in which you 
can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element, 
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.

2. On the image itself, you can 
use the use the margin property 
and set the values of the left and 
right margins to auto.

### background-image :

+ The background-image
property allows you to place 
an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box.
The path to the image follows 
the letters url, and it is put 
inside parentheses and quotes.

**see the example below** :

+ background-repeat :

1. repeat
The background image is 
repeated both horizontally and 
vertically (the default way it 
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

2. repeat-x
The image is repeated 
horizontally only (as shown in 
the first example on the left).

3. repeat-y
The image is repeated vertically 
only.

4. no-repeat
The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment 
property specifies whether a 
background image should stay in 
one position or move as the user 
scrolls up and down the page. 

### Contrast of background images :

If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low 
contrast in order for the text to be legible.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) :

1. **On-Page Techniques** :
On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.
The main component of this is 
looking at keywords that people 
are likely to enter into a search 
engine if they wanted to find 
your site, and then including 
these in the text and HTML code 
for your site in order to help the 
search engines know that your 
site covers these topics.

2. **Off-Page Techniques** :
Getting other sites to link to you 
is just as important as on-page 
techniques. Search engines help 
determine how to rank your 
site by looking at the number of 
other sites that link to yours.
They are particularly interested 
in sites whose content is related 
to yours. For example, if you 
were running a website that 
sold fish bait, then a link from 
a hairdresser is not likely to be 
considered as relevant as one 
from an angling community.


### How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?

This is the number of times 
people have come to your site. If 
someone is inactive on your site 
for 30 minutes and then looks at 
another page on your site, it will 
be counted as a new visit.

+ Unique Visits :
This is the total number of 
people who have visited your site 
over the specified period. The 
number of unique visits will be 
lower than the number of visits 
if people have been returning to 
your site more than once in the 
defined period.

visitors have viewed on your site.
