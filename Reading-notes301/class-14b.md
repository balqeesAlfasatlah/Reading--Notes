## What ideas do you have for projects?

I think of making an online library for all kinds of books 

## What would your model be that you can control and update the view with?

we can create custom views of libraries and lists to organize and show items that are most important to you (like certain columns), to add filtering or sorting, or to have a more engaging style. You can create a personal view (that only you can see) or, if you have permissions to do so, you can create a public view for everyone who uses the list to see.

## What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?

Google Books one of the resources to make book content more discoverable on the Web. Using the Google Books API, your application can perform full-text searches and retrieve book information, viewability and eBook availability. You can also manage your personal bookshelves.
