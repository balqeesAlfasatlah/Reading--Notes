# SQL vs NoSQL


| SQL | NoSQL  | 
| :---:   | :-: |
|called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | called as non-relational or distributed database. |
SQL databases are table based databases  | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
have predefined schema  |  have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
vertically scalable  | horizontally scalable |
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | queries are focused on collection of documents.

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
 best fit for vertically data storage

## Give a real world example.
MySQL Community Edition

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
its better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

## Give a real world example.
Hbase 

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic

## What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language

## What is a realational database?
is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What is a ‘schema’?

its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS).
