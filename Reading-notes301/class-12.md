# SQL vs NoSQL


| SQL | NoSQL  | 
| :---:   | :-: |
|called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | called as non-relational or distributed database. |
SQL databases are table based databases  | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
have predefined schema  |  have dynamic schema for unstructured data.|
vertically scalable  | horizontally scalable |
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data | queries are focused on collection of documents.

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
 best fit for vertically data storage

## Give a real world example.
MySQL Community Edition

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
its better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

## Give a real world example.
Hbase 

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic

## What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language

## What is a realational database?
is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

in general data  is structured as a tables 

## What is a ‘schema’?

its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS).

## What is a NoSQL database?
database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database and its document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores

## Howo does it work?
its store the data in documents 

## What is inside of a Mongo database?
collections have a set of documents
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB
## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data. While you can use NoSQL for transactions purpose, it is still not comparable and sable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.
