# React


## What Is React ?

  Its a flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

 ##  Whats JSX ? 

 syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like.

## component :
 

1. **What is a component ?**

   A component is a reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interfacem and is a software object, intended to interact with other components.

2. **What are the charactistics of a component ?**

* Reusability : Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations. 

* Replaceable : Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* Not context specific : Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* Extensible : component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* Encapsulated : component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* Independent : Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

3. **What are the advantages of using component based architecture ?**

+ Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

+ Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

+ Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

+ Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

+ Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

##  Props and how we can use it in react :

1. **What is props short for ?**

     is a special keyword in React which stands for properties .

2. **How are props used in React ?**

    It used for passing data from one component to another.

3. **What is the flow of props ?**

    It can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child)
