## Forms

### Why Forms?

The best known form on the web is probably 
the search box that sits right in the middle of 
Google's homepage.

In addition to enabling users to 
search, forms also allow users 
to perform other functions 
online. You will see forms.

### Form Control :

1. ADDING TEXT :

+ Text  : (single-line)
Used for a single line of text such 
as email addresses and names.

+ Password input :
Like a single line text box but it 
masks the characters entered.

+ Text area  : (multi-line)
For longer areas of text, such as 
messages and comments.

2. Making Choices:

+ Radio buttons :
For use when a user must select 
one of a number of options

+ Checkboxes :
When a user can select and 
unselect one or more options.

+ Drop-down boxes :
When a user must pick one of a 
number of options from a list.

3. Submitting Forms:

+ Submit buttons :
To submit data from your form 
to another web page.

+ Image buttons :
Similar to submit buttons but 
they allow you to use an image

+ File upload :
Allows users to upload files 
(e.g. images) to a website.

### Table-properties :

+ width : to set the width of the 
table.

+ padding : to set the space 
between the border of each table 
cell and its content.

+ text-transform : to convert the 
content of the table headers to 
uppercase.

+ letter-spacing, font-size :
to add additional styling to the 
content of the table headers.

+ border-top, border-bottom :
to set borders above and below 
the table headers.

+ text-align :to align the writing 
to the left of some table cells and 
to the right of the others.

**Gaps Between Cells
border-spacing, border-collapse** :

+ collapse :
Borders are collapsed into a 
single border where possible. 
(border-spacing will be 
ignored and cells pushed 
together, and empty-cells
properties will be ignored.).

+ separate :
Borders are detached from each 
other. (border-spacing and 
empty-cells will be obeyed.)

+ HOW EVENTS TRIGGER 
JAVASCRIPT CODE ?

When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three 
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. 
Together these steps are known as event handling. 

1. Select the element 
node(s) you want the 
script to respond to. 

2. Indicate which event on 
the selected node(s) will 
trigger the response. 

3. State the code you want 
to run when the event 
occurs. 

+  Three ways to buld event to an element :

Event handlers let you indicate which event you 
are waiting for on any particular element. 
There are three types of event handlers.

1. Html event handlers.

2. DOM event handlers.

3. Event listeners.
