## lists 

![type of lists](https://www.roseindia.net/tutorialfiles/31257.lists.jpg)

**Ordered lists**  are lists where each item in the list is 
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for 
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
where each point needs to be identified by a section 
number.

**Unordered lists**  are lists that begin with a bullet point 
(rather than characters that indicate order).

**Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the 
definitions for each of those terms.

**see the decription below it contains the type of the list and how we can write it in html** :

## Boxes 

+ ### Box Dimensions : width, height

By default a box is sized just big 
enough to hold its contents. To 
set your own dimensions for a 
box you can use the height and 
width properties.
The most popular ways to 
specify the size of a box are 
to use pixels, percentages, or 
ems. Traditionally, pixels have 
been the most popular method 
because they allow designers to 
accurately control their size.

+ ### Limiting Width : min-width, max-width

Some page designs expand and 
shrink to fit the size of the user's 
screen. In such designs, the 
min-width property specifies 
the smallest size a box can be 
displayed at when the browser 
window is narrow, and the 
max-width property indicates 
the maximum width a box can 
stretch to when the browser 
window is wide.
These are very helpful properties 
to ensure that the content of 
pages are legible (especially on 
the smaller screens of handheld 
devices). For example, you can 
use the max-width property to 
ensure that lines of text do not 
appear too wide within a big 
browser window and you can 
use the min-width property 
to make sure that they do not 
appear too narrow.

+ ### Overflowing Content : overflow

The overflow property tells the 
browser what to do if the content 
contained within a box is larger 
than the box itself.

 **It can have 
one of two values:**

1. hidden : This property simply hides any 
extra content that does not fit in 
the box.

2. scroll : This property adds a scrollbar to 
the box so that users can scroll 
to see the missing content.

**Here is a Full example :**

+ ### Change Inline/Block : display

The display property allows 
you to turn an inline element 
into a block-level element or vice 
versa, and can also be used to 
hide an element from the page.

**The values this property can 
take are :**

1. inline : This causes a block-level 
element to act like an inline 
element.

2. block : This causes an inline element to 
act like a block-level element.

3. inline-block : This causes a block-level 
element to flow like an inline 
element, while retaining other 
features of a block-level element.

4. none : This hides an element from the 
page. In this case, the element 
acts as though it is not on the 
page at all (although a user could 
still see the content of the box if 
they used the view source option 
in their browser).

# Javascript



## ARRAYS :

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values.

+ CREATING AN ARRAY :

You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of 
the array). 


+ VALUES IN ARRAYS :

Values in an array are accessed as if they are in 
a numbered list. It is important to know that the 
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

**See the example below  :**

## SWITCH STATEMENTS :

A switch statement starts with a 
variable called the switch value. 
Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the 
variable matches that value.

**Here an example you can check how we can write the switch :**

## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES :

Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript 
can be treated as if it were true or false; and 
this has some interesting side effects. 

1. Falsy values are treated as if they 
are fa 1 se. The table to the left 
shows a hi ghScore variable with 
a series of values, all of which 
are falsy.
Falsy values can also be treated 
as the number 0 .

2. Truthy values are treated as if 
they are true. Almost everything 
that is not in the falsy table can 
be treated as if it were true. 
Truthy values can also be treated 
as the number 1.

## Loops :

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

**Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:**

1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times.

2. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

3. do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
