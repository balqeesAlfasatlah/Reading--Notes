# CSS

## Building Blocks :

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks 
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can 
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the 
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use 
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.


## Containing Elements :

If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the **containing or parent element** .

It is common to group a number of elements together inside a div (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together 
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and 
the main navigation). The div element that contains this group of 
elements is then referred to as the containing element.


## positioning schemes :

allow you to control 
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute 
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

1. Normal flow :Every block-level element 
appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down 
the page than the previous one.

2. Relative Positioning :This moves an element from the 
position it would be in normal 
flow, shifting it to the top, right, 
bottom, or left of where it 
would have been placed. This 
does not affect the position of 
surrounding elements; they stay 
in the position they would be in 
in normal flow.

3. Absolute positioning :This positions the element 
in relation to its containing 
element. It is taken out of 
normal flow, meaning that it 
does not affect the position 
of any surrounding elements 
(as they simply ignore the 
space it would have taken up). 
Absolutely positioned elements 
move as users scroll up and 
down the page.

### Floating elements :

The float property allows you 
to take an element in normal 
flow and place it as far to the 
left or right of the containing 
element as possible.
Anything else that sits inside 
the containing element will 
flow around the element that is 
floated.

## Screen Sizes :

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show 
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to 
work on a range of different sized screens.

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web 
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## CSS Frameworks :

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for 
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating 
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS 
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

## Layout Grids :

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) 
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are 
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them 
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.


While a grid might seem like a restriction, in actual fact it:
+ Creates a continuity between different pages which may 
use different designs.

+ Helps users predict where to find information on various 
pages.

+ Makes it easier to add new content to the site in a 
consistent way.

+ Helps people collaborate on the design of a site in a 
consistent way.
